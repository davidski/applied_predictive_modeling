Working notes for the `compute` (general principles) and `exercises` 
(specific open ended tasks) sections of Kuhn & Johnson's Applied Predictive 
Modeling text. Where practical, examples are converted to `tidyverse` versions.

This repository is a companion to an internal weekly bookclub on the topic. 
We're going through a chapter a week.
